# Gravity Falls Trivia

This is a simple trivia game based on the animated series "Gravity Falls".
The game consists of a series of questions about the show, and the player has to answer them correctly to score points.

## Technology Stack

- Vite
- React (JavaScript)
- React Router
- Redux Toolkit
- Tailwind CSS

This webapp does not use any backend server. All the data is stored in the frontend using Redux Toolkit.

## Why This Project?

This project was created as a fun way to practice Tailwind and Redux Toolkit.
Also, I am a big fan of the show, so it was a great opportunity to combine my interests.
